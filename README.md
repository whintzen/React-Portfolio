## Instructions

* Open a terminal and run these commands to set up the environment files `npm init`, `npm install`, 
  `npm install react-router-dom`, `npm install react`, `npm install react-dom`, `npm install bootstrap`, and `npm install bootstrap-react` to create the node_modules folder and to add additional information to package json.  
  * Run `npm start`, this connect you to the PORT 3000 and also open the React-Portfoli0 Application in the browser.
  * Once the App opens, click on the Navigation links to move from the `Home Page` to the `About` and `Portfolio` pages.  THis is a very straight forward app, with no bells or whistles.
